# Step 1: Read data from the CSV file.
# Load all records into memory (e.g., using pandas or csv module).

# Step 2: Validate missing values.
# If both 'company name' and 'symbol' are missing, log an error and skip that row.

# Step 3: Enrich data using Finnhub API.
# Use either the company name or symbol to fetch additional company details from Finnhub.
# Update the record with the new data (e.g., industry, market cap, etc.).

# Step 4: Save updated records.
# Write enriched data to a temporary CSV file for review or further processing.
# Log any failed rows separately for debugging.
